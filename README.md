# Advent Of Code

My solutions to this year's advent of code, written in Rust to get a better
idea of how to use the language.

## Disclaimer

Why did I not use cargo, and instead this wacky wrap-around? Not really certain
myself, but I yes.

## Usage

All exercises follow the naming convention `d{day_number}-{problem_name}.rs`.

### With the Runner Utility

```bash
# Compile the runner if haven't done so
rustc runner.rs

# Print help information
./runner

# Sample, run problem 1
./runner d01-trebuchet.rs run
```
